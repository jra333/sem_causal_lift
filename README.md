# Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) Analysis & App

**Two folders include:**
- SEM [App](https://github.com/jra333/sem_causal_lift/tree/main/sem_app_testing) POC using Streamlit

An interactive web application built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that enables users to perform Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) on their data. The app integrates data upload, preprocessing (with time series support), dynamic model specification, SEM analysis using [semopy](https://github.com/semopy/semopy), and AI-generated interpretations via Google Gemini.

- Causal Impact Analysis [Notebook](https://github.com/jra333/sem_causal_lift/tree/main/sem_notebooks)

The integrated impact analysis was able to prove that upper-funnel metrics contribute to sales through modeling and predicting sales using a scenario based approach. Explored and confirmed the lift in sales using a custom structural equation model highlighting the pathways in upper-funnel that lead to sales increase.

  - Performs comprehensive data aggregation (daily, weekly, and monthly) on raw sales data.
  - Implements advanced visualization techniques including time series plots, correlation heatmaps, and channel comparison plots.
  - Conducts integrated causal impact analysis combining Random Forest and OLS regression approaches.
  - Provides detailed elasticity analysis with statistical inferences and seasonal impact assessments.
